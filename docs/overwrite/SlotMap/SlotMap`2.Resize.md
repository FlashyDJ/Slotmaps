Use this method to adjust the size of the internal storage of the slot map if needed. The <code class="paramref">newSize</code> parameter should be greater than or equal to the current capacity of the slot map. If the <code class="paramref">newSize</code> is equal to the current capacity, no resizing occurs, and the method returns immediately.
