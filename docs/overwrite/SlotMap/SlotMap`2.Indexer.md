Use this indexer to access the value associated with a specific slot key in the slot map. If the <code class="paramref">key</code> is not found in the map during the get operation, a [KeyNotFoundException](xref:System.Collections.Generic.KeyNotFoundException) is thrown. To set the value associated with a <code class="paramref">key</code>, assign a new value to this indexer.
